**Core value:** Aus einer rohen Kundenliste pro Zeile zwei nachvollziehbare, sortierbare Scores (Website-Bedarf + Zahlungskräftigkeit) erzeugen; ideale Leads zuoberst. Excel rein -> Excel raus.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Smallest E2E slice first (Phase 1: ~4 rows, trivial scores, xlsx out) per CLAUDE.md §5; PO reviews intermediate result before full-list processing.
- [Roadmap]: Optional/network tiers (PageSpeed = Phase 6) come late and stay skippable — tool fully runnable end-to-end before they exist (graceful degradation).
- [Roadmap]: Cache + concurrency (Phase 5) precedes the rate-limited PageSpeed tier so resumability exists before long runs.
- [Roadmap]: LLM layer is v2 (DIFF-02), not a v1 phase; folds into hardening only if a key is present.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 6] PageSpeed keyless quota and Zefix (v2) anonymous access are unresolved — both mitigated by being optional with heuristic fallbacks.
